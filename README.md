# Buger President

## Description

Burger President is a short exploration/adventure game, where you are both a human worker and a rat. You must help the rat escape the room out the vent. The main twist is that you can switch between being human sized as the human and rat sized as the rat, to help them escape. The human must create a path for the rat to be able to open and escape through the vent. 


## Ella's resources:

-no tutorials watched or referenced

-Re-used models and changed models from past projects

Hurdles:

- The particle system would not work to use a mesh collider and have the particles bounce onto the mesh collider of the vent
       - So we opted for an end win screen that is towards the back of the vent

- Making a clear instruction for the players
      - We made a clipboard on the desk with instructions

Not really any resources online used. Mainly working with scaling the player object and teleport object in order to change the player size without giving you larger teleport range. Also gave the player ability to pickup objects off the ground via lazer, this inspired by H3VR, didn't use animation or other things for that just as it is an accessiblity feature and kinda was how it was from H3. 

Teleport zones on the boxes ended up being just slightly larger cubes with the applied teleport area script. Have a dynamic zone setup where you could only teleport to the top of the boxes but didn't use as it was quite diffficult to change the teleport pointer's arc to make it possible to land it on the top of the boxes.
