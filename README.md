Ella's resources:

-no tutorials watched or referenced
-Re-used models and changed models from past projects


Hurdles:

-The particle system would not work to use a mesh collider and have the particles bounce onto the mesh collider of the vent
       -So we opted for an end win screen that is towards the back of the vent


-Making a clear instruction for the players
       -We made a clipboard on the desk with instructions
